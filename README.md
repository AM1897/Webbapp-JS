#WebShop-JS

##Frontend Webshop
During the early stages of my education as a web developer, we created this project. WebShop-JS is a simple website with a focus on frontend development, where we prioritized the shopping cart functionality. We designed the shopping cart to calculate both the number of products and the total price.

To encourage larger orders, we implemented a delivery discount: when the total amount exceeds 259 SEK, delivery is free. If the total amount is less than 259 SEK, delivery costs 159 SEK.
