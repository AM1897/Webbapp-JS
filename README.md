# WebShop-JS
Frontend Webshop 

At the beginning of my education as a web developer, we carried out this project.

It is a simple website with a focus on front-end, where we prioritized the shopping cart functionality. In our case, we designed the shopping cart to calculate both the number of products and the price. I decided that when the total exceeds 259 SEK, the delivery would be free, while it would cost 159 SEK for delivery if the amount was lower than that.
